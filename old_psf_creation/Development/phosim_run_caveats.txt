Errors and lessons
======================

1.
two electron images
=====================
instance catalogs files created by 'create_20_catalogs.py' will have only 3
lines in the catalog files.

when i run:

cd ~/phosim; ./phosim Research/twenty_catalogs/instance_catalogs/catalog0.icat -c examples/nobackground -o Research/twenty_catalogs/outputs/catalog0_out


I got TWO _e_ images


solution:
do not use only three lines as like 'examples/small_catalog' use many lines as from 'examples/star'


2.
round shaped output fitsfiles
===============================

choose higher magnitude star
